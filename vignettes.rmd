# Package documentation {#vignettes}

Vignettes are long-form pdf guides to your package. Function documentation is useful once you know exactly what you want to do, and you've discovered the appropriate function: once you've done all that, you can use `help()` to learn how to use the function appropriately. Vignettes get you to point where you can do that: they explain what the package does as a whole, breaks the functions down into useful categories, and shows you how to combine the functions (and maybe functions from other packages) to solve problems.

You can see all the vignettes in installed packages with `browseVignettes()`, or for a specific package with `browseVignettes("packagename")`. You can open a specific vignette with `vignette(x)`, and see its code with `edit(vignette(x))`. Vignettes are also listed on the CRAN page for the package. For each vignette you get three things: the original input file, the rendered html or pdf, and a file of R code. 

Before R 3.0.0, only way to create vignetes was with Sweave and Latex. This was hard, because it required you to both understand latex. Additionally the latex toolchain is large, and building a pdf with latex takes some time. Together, these things made it unusual for me to write a vignette. Now, any package can provide a vignette __engine__, a standard interface for turning input files into html or pdf vignettes. In this chapter, we're going to use the rmarkdown vignette engine provided by the knitr package. I recommend this engine because:

* You write in markdown, a plain text formatting system. Markdown is limited
  compared to latex, but this limitation is good because it forces you to
  focus on content, rather than appearance.
  
* It uses knitr to allow you to intermingle code and text.

* Markdown and knitr are coordinated using the 
  [rmarkdown package](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). It uses the powerful
  [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc) to convert markdown to html.

Once I switched to using rmarkdown for vignettes I found that my productivity increased, and I enjoyed writing them more, so I've written far more vignettes in rmarkdown than I ever did in Sweave.

Currently, the easiest way to get Rmarkdown is to use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). Otherwise, you'll need to `devtools::install_github("rstudio/rmarkdown")` and [install pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html).  

## Vignette workflow

To create your first vignette, run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::use_vignette("my-vignette")
```

This will:

1.  Create a `vignettes/` directory.

1.  Add the necessary dependencies to `DESCRIPTION` (i.e. knitr in suggests and 
    vignette builder).

1.  Creates a draft vignette, `my-vignette.Rmd`.

The draft vignette has been designed to remind of the important parts of an rmarkdown file, so it should be a useful reference when you're creating a new vignette.

Once you have this file, the workflow is simple:

1.  Modify the vignette.

2.  Press Cmd + Shift + K (or click 
    `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/knit.png", dpi = 220)`) to knit the 
    vignette and preview the output.

You then write vignettes using markdown and knitr (= rmarkdown), which are described below.

## Metadata

The first few lines of the vignette contain important metadata. The default template contains the following information:

    ---
    title: "Vignette Title"
    author: "Vignette Author"
    date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
    output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
    vignette: >
      %\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title}
      %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
      %\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
    ---

This metadata is recorded in [yaml](http://www.yaml.org/) format, a format designed to be both human and computer readable. The basics of the syntax is much like the DESCRIPTION, each line consists of a field name, a colon, then the value of the field. The one special YAML feature we're using here is `>`: that indicates the the following lines of text are regular text and shouldn't use any special YAML features.

The fields are:

* Title, author and date: the title of the vignette, author and date.
  You will probably want to fill these in yourself (or you can delete them if 
  you don't want the title block at the top of the page). The date is filled 
  in by default: it uses a special knitr syntax (explained below) to insert 
  today's date. 
  
* Output: this tells rmarkdown what output format specification to use. 
  There are many options that are useful for regular reports (including
  html, pdf, slideshows, ...) but `rmarkdown::html_vignette` has been 
  specifically designed to work well inside packages. See 
  `?rmarkdown::html_vignette` for more details.
  
* Vignette: this contains a special block of metadata needed by R.
  You can see some of the history of vignettes here: originally all vignettes 
  were written in Sweave which uses latex, so the vignette metadata was also 
  written in Sweave. You need to modifiy the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to provide 
  the title of your vignette, as it will appear in the vignette index. Leave 
  the other two lines as is.  They tell R to use `knitr` to process this
  file, and that it's encoded in UTF-8. (The only valid encoding.)

## Markdown {#markdown}

Rmarkdown vignettes are written in markdown. John Gruber, the author of markdown, does a good job of summarising the goals and philosophy of markdown:

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

> Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted 
> document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like 
> it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s 
> syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — 
> including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — 
> the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format 
> of plain text email.

> To this end, Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation 
> characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as 
> to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look 
> like *emphasis*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes 
> look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email.

Markdown isn't as powerful as latex or reStructuredText or docbook, but it is simple, easy to write, and easy to read even when not rendered. I find the constraints of markdown actively helpful for writing because it lets me focus on the content, and prevents me from messing around with the styling.

If you've never used markdown before, a good place to start is the [Markdown syntax documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), written by John Gruber, the author of the original markdown. However, pandoc's implementation of markdown cleans up a number of rough edges and adds considerable new features. Also recommend familiarising yourself with the [pandoc readme](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html).  The sections below summarise the most important markdown features. You should be up and running very quickly.

### Sections

Headings are identified by `#`:

    # Heading 1
    ## Heading 2
    ### Heading 3

Create a horizontal rule with three or more hyphens (or asterisks):

    --------
    ********

### Lists

Basic unordered lists use `*`:

    * Bulleted list
    * Item 2
        * Item 2a (notice 4-space indent)
        * Item 2b    

Ordered lists use: `1.`:
    
    1. Item 1
    1. Item 2
    1. Items numbered automatically, even though they all start with 1.

If you want multiparagh lists, the second and subsequent paragphs need more indenting:

      * It's possible to put multiple paragraphs of text in a list item. 
    
        But to do that, the second and subsequent paragraphs must be
        indented by four or more spaces. That looks better if the first
        bullet is also indented.

Definition lists use ` : `

    Definition
      : a statement of the exact meaning of a word, especially in a dictionary.
    List 
      : a number of connected items or names written or printed consecutively, 
        typically one below the other. 
      : barriers enclosing an area for a jousting tournament.

### Inline formatting

    _italic_, *italic*
    __bold__, **bold**    
    [link text](destination)
    <http://this-is-a-raw-url.com>

### Tables

...

### Code

For code inline use `` `code` ``:

    For code inline use `code`

For bigger blocks of use, use ```` ``` ````. These are known as "fenced" code blocks:

    ```
    # A comment
    add <- function(a, b) a + b
    ```

To add syntax highlighting to the code, put the language name after the backtick:

    ```c
    int add(int a, int b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    ```

(At time of printing, list of support languages was: actionscript, ada, apache, asn1, asp, awk, bash, bibtex, boo, c, changelog, clojure, cmake, coffee, coldfusion, commonlisp, cpp, cs, css, curry, d, diff, djangotemplate, doxygen, doxygenlua, dtd, eiffel, email, erlang, fortran, fsharp, gnuassembler, go, haskell, haxe, html, ini, java, javadoc, javascript, json, jsp, julia, latex, lex, literatecurry, literatehaskell, lua, makefile, mandoc, matlab, maxima, metafont, mips, modula2, modula3, monobasic, nasm, noweb, objectivec, objectivecpp, ocaml, octave, pascal, perl, php, pike, postscript, prolog, python, r, relaxngcompact, rhtml, ruby, rust, scala, scheme, sci, sed, sgml, sql, sqlmysql, sqlpostgresql, tcl, texinfo, verilog, vhdl, xml, xorg, xslt, xul, yacc, yaml. Syntax highlighting is done by the haskell package [highlighting-kate](http://johnmacfarlane.net/highlighting-kate); see the website for current list.)

When you include R code in your vignette, you usually won't use ```` ```r ````, instead you'll use ```` ```{r} ````, which is specially processed by knitr, as described next.

## Knitr

Knitr allows you to intermingle code, results and text. A knitr block looks similar to a fenced code block, but instead of writing `r`, you write `{r}`.

    ```{r}
    # Add two numbers together
    add <- function(a, b) a + b
    add(10, 20)
    ```

Knitr will take that code, and run it. As it runs, it captures the output, then later replays it formatted as markdown. It captures printed output, messsages, warnings, errors (optionally) and plots (basic graphics, lattice & ggplot and more). This example is simple, and will generate the following markdown:

    ```r
    # Add two numbers together
    add <- function(a, b) a + b
    add(10, 20)
    ## [1] 30
    ```

Then when the documented is rendered to HTML, pandoc will display that as:

```r
# Add two numbers together
add <- function(a, b) a + b
add(10, 20)
## 30
```

Once you start using knitr in this way, you'll never look back. You can rest easy knowing that all your code works (because it's run when you build the vignette) and there's no way for input and output to be out of sync.

### Options

You can specify additional options to control the details of the rendering: ```` ```{r, opt1 = val1, opt2 = val2} ````. The most important are listed below:

* `eval = FALSE`. Don't evaluate the code. This is useful if you want
  to show some code that would take a long time to run. Be careful when you
  use this - since the code is no longer run, it's easy to introduce bugs.
  (Your users will be puzzled when they copy & paste code and it doesn't
  work.)

* `echo = FALSE`. Turns of the printing of the code _input_ (the output)
  will still be printed.  Generally, you shouldn't use this in vingettes
  because understand what the code is doing is important.

* `results = "hide"`. Don't print code _output_.

* `warning = FALSE`, `message = FALSE`. Suppresses display of warnings
  or messages.

*   `results = "asis"`. Treat the output of your R code as literal markdown.
    This is useful if you want to generate text from your R code. For example,
    if you want to generate a table using the pander package, you'd do
  
        ```{r, results = "asis"}
        pander::pandoc.table(iris[1:3, 1:4])
        ```
    
    That generates a markdown table that looks like:
    
        --------------------------------------------------------
         Sepal.Length   Sepal.Width   Petal.Length   Petal.Width 
        -------------- ------------- -------------- -------------
             5.1            3.5           1.4            0.2     
        
             4.9             3            1.4            0.2     
        
             4.7            3.2           1.3            0.2     
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        
    Which makes a table that looks like this:
    
    --------------------------------------------------------
     Sepal.Length   Sepal.Width   Petal.Length   Petal.Width 
    -------------- ------------- -------------- -------------
         5.1            3.5           1.4            0.2     
    
         4.9             3            1.4            0.2     
    
         4.7            3.2           1.3            0.2     
    ---------------------------------------------------------

* `error = TRUE`: use this if you want knitr to capture any errors in 
  the block and show them inline. This is useful if you want to demonstrate 
  what happens if code throws an error.

* `collapse = TRUE`, `comment = "#>"`: use my preferred way of displaying
  code output.  I usually set these globally by putting the following knitr
  block at the start of my document.

        ```{r, echo = FALSE}
        knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#">)
        ```

* `fig.show = "hold"`: hold all figures until the end of the code block.

* `fig.width = 5`, `fig.height = 5`: set the height and width of figures
  (in inches).

There are many other options. You can find a complete list at <http://yihui.name/knitr/options>. 

## Development cycle

Run code a chunk at a time using Cmd + Alt + C. Re-run the entire document in a fresh R session using Knit (Cmd + Shift + K). You can build all vignettes from the console with `devtools::build_vignettes()`, but this is rarely useful. Instead rely on `build()` to create a package bundle with the vignettes included.

Note that RStudio's "Build & reload" does not build vignettes (in the interest of saving time). All install functions (like `install_github()`) will ensure vignettes are built by default, most have an argument to turn off if it's time consuming.

## Advice for writing vignettes

> If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.
> --- Leslie Lamport

Literally anything written by Kathy Sierra.

Think of this as a teaching opportunity.  Put yourself in your reader/users shoes.

I find writing vignettes tremendously improves the quality of my code because it forces me to adopt the "beginners mind". It forces you to re-see the initial onboarding process and to appreciate the parts that are hard.  Every time I have written a vignette the process of starting from the beginning and explaining the details has made me realise that I've missed some important functions. Adding those functions not only helps my users, but it often also helps me!  (This is one of the reasons that I like writing books too). 

Can also make a nice break from coding. If you're brain is tired of programming, try working on the vignettes - writing seems to use a rather different part of your brain that might not be tired yet (much like the idea of cross-training). 

I also like the idea of <http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/>.

## Organisation

For simpler packages, often one vignette is sufficient. But for more complicated packages you may need more than one. You can have as many vignettes as you like. I tend to think of them like chapters of a book - they should be self-contained, but can link together into a cohesive whole. 

You can link between various vignettes, although it's a slight hack because it takes advantage of the exactly how files are stored on disk. If you want to link to a vignette `abc.Rmd`, just make a link to `abc.html`.

## CRAN notes

If you're submitting your package to CRAN, you'll also need to watch the file size. If you include a lot of graphics, it's easy to create a very large file.

Note that you do vignette building locally, so that CRAN recieves the html/pdf and the source code. CRAN checks that the code is runnable (by running it), but does not re-build the vignette. This means that any packages used by the vignette must be declared in the `DESCRIPTION`. This means that you can use Rmarkdown (which uses pandoc) even though CRAN doesn't have pandoc installed.

Common problems:

*   The vignette builds interactively, but when checking, fails with an error 
    about a missing package that you know is installed. This means that you've
    forgotten to declare that dependency in the `DESCRIPTION` (usually it should
    go in suggests).

*   Everything works interactively, but the vignette doesn't show up after you've
    installed the package. First, remember that RStudio's "build and reload" 
    doesn't build vignettes, so instead run `devtools::install()`. Next check:
  
    1. The directory is called `vignettes/` and not `vignette/`.

    1. Check that you haven't inadvertently excluded the vignettes with
       `.Rbuildignore`
       
    1. Ensure you have the necessary vignette metadata.

*   `error = TRUE`

## Where next

If you write a nice vignette, you might want to consider submitting it to the Journal of Statistical Software or the R Journal. Both are electronic only journals and peer-reviewing can be very helpful for improving the quality of your vignette and the related software.
